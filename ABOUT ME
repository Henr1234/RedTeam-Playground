I am Lavish Dhawan, a cybersecurity enthusiast passionate about red teaming, penetration testing, and web security. I enjoy building and experimenting with intentionally vulnerable applications like Red Team Playground to improve my skills and help others learn. My current focus is on bug bounty hunting, exploit development, and preparing for advanced certifications such as OSCP. I believe in learning by breaking, analyzing, and fixing systems, and Iâ€™m always exploring new ways to strengthen security through practical research and hands-on practice.
